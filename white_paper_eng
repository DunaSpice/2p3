Main characteristics

Scriptons: Autonomous scripts with AI elements that adapt and change their code depending on.
Interaction: Communication via dynamic databasesqlite3 and groups for tasks.
Technical Implementation: Running on Python 3.12, automating the installation of the necessary resources.
Main Technical Aspects of the Scripton System:

1. Integration and Personalization:
Scriptons analyze user input to create personalized solutions, using adaptability and learning to optimize their functionality.

2. Using Language Models:
Use natural language analysis to determine optimal algorithms and integrate with advanced language models to analyze queries and context.

3. Safety and Reliability:
Protect data and interactions using encryption and blockchain technologies, including controls to ensure compliance with security standards.

4. Versatility and Scalability:
Development of a project with the possibility of wide application and easy expansion, including dynamic expansion through the generation of new scriptons.

5. Architecture and Interaction:
Creation of autonomous environments connected to a trusted server for data exchange via JSON structures that ensure coordination of actions between scriptons.

6. Learning and Adaptation:
of Scriptonare being trained based on new data, constantly improving its functionality to adapt to changing conditions and tasks.

7. Interaction between Users and Scripts:
Users can exchange, buy and sell scriptons, creating personalized solutions and expanding the functionality of the system.

Operating Principle of the Scripton System:
Installation and Launch:

The system runs on the user's device using Python 3.12, where the main script installs the necessary programs, libraries and checks the system's functionality. In the future, the system will take basic settings from a trusted medium. A crypto network will be used for this.

Dynamic Communication:
Scriptons communicate with each other and with groups of scriptons through a dynamic database, using it to coordinate actions.

Development and Expansion:
The project involves the creation and expansion of functionality through the generation of new scriptons, including the ability to configure it to work with different models.

Innovative Features:

Scriptons are digital assistants that can perform tasks through special “packets of code”, providing a convenient and secure interface for the user.

The project involves the creation and expansion of functionality through the generation of new scriptons, including the ability to configure it to work with different models and the creation of servers and other ongoing processes that are transferred to resources over time.

Thus, we are all together building a unified network of solutions that will soon allow us to implement all new opportunities.

Development and Versions:

1. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)(01/2024): 
   - Functions: Access to all local system resources. Installing and launching resources for the user. (One scripton)
2. Version 0.1 (03/2024):
   - Features: Combining scriptons into commands, improved interface, different options for scripton threading.
3. Version 0.2 (04/2024):
   - Functions: Exchange your scriptons and/or rent and/or sell using a cryptocurrency wallet.
4. Version 0.3 (05/2024):
   - Functions: Possibility of chatting, joint thinking is assumed.

These implementation stages reflect the gradual development of the project from a working prototype with basic functionality to a complex system with groups of scripts, interface improvements, exchange and trading capabilities, ending with the ability for users to interact via chat.
Examples of using Scripton:
Application of Scripton:
Traveler AI: Create personalized walking itineraries and plan trips based on your budget and preferences, including hotel bookings and attraction analysis.
Automation of Review Analytics: Deep analysis of data from social networks and customer reviews to obtain business insights.
Interactive Learning: Development of automated educational programs with adaptive learning through messengers.
Smart Web Hosting: Automation of web server and application management, including integration with analytical tools.
Cross-Platform Chat Bot: Development of bots for communication in various social networks and instant messengers.
Autoresponder for Business: Creating automatic responses to client requests in different communication channels.
Message Forwarding: Set up automatic forwarding of messages between channels based on specified criteria.

How can you participate?
To implement the project, we created a DAO on the Aragon platform in the Optimism network.

First stage of financing:

Initially, two founders received 125 thousand 2P3 tokens each.

Issue of 500 thousand tokens at a price of starting from 0.1 USDT

After we finish the first stage, all co-founders will have the opportunity to participate in resolving the issue of further attraction and/or in any future proposal before any others.
